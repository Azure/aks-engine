For use on the [Azure Stack Hub product](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-overview) this project is fully supported and will continue to be supported by the Hub team throughout the lifespan of Azure Stack Hub. Development is already moved to a new Azure Stack Hub specific repository ([Azure/aks-engine-azurestack](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack)). This new repository is where new [releases](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/releases) for Azure Stack Hub clouds will be published and where [issues](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine-azurestack/issues/new) concerning Azure Stack Hub should be created.

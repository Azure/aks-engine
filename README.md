AKS Engine is the easiest way to provision a self-managed Kubernetes cluster on Azure.

## Overview

AKS Engine provides convenient tooling to quickly bootstrap Kubernetes clusters on Azure. By leveraging [ARM (Azure Resource Manager)][ARM], AKS Engine helps you create, destroy and maintain clusters provisioned with basic IaaS resources in Azure.

## Getting started

- Read the [CLI Overview](docs/tutorials/cli-overview.md) for a list of features provided by the `aks-engine` command line tool.

- The [Quickstart Guide](docs/tutorials/quickstart.md) describes how to download the latest release of `aks-engine` for your environment, and demonstrates how to use `aks-engine` to create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure that you will manage and customize.

- The [complete body of documentation can be found here][docs].

Please see the [FAQ][] for answers about AKS Engine and its progenitor ACS-Engine.

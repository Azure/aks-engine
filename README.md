## Overview

AKS-Engine leverages ARM (Azure Resource Manager) to build Kubernetes IaaS in Azure. Originally [acs-engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine), the project has moved here (1) to evolve without harming its legacy non-k8s bits that other non-k8s Azure upstream projects depend upon, and (2) to better reflect its affinity with [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks), Azure's managed Kubernetes service offering.

## Under Construction

We are currently in transition from acs-engine to aks-engine! Bear with us as we stabilize this space as the future home for building customizable, self-managed Kubernetes on Azure!

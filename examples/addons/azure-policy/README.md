# Azure Policy Add-on

Azure Policy integrates with the AKS Engine to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner. By extending use of [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) v3 (beta), an _admission controller webhook_ for Kubernetes, Azure Policy makes it possible to manage and report on the compliance state of your Azure resources and AKS Engine clusters from one place.


> [!NOTE]
> Azure Policy for AKS Engine is in Public Preview. The service only supports built-in policy definitions
> and a single AKS Engine cluster for each resource group configured with a Service Principal.
> Gatekeeper v3 is in Beta and is supported by the open source community.


For detailed instructions to enable and use Azure policy add-on for AKS Engine, please refer [Install Azure Policy Add-on on AKS Engine](https://aka.ms/kubepolicydoc).

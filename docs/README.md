Everything you need to know about AKS Engine.

## How the documentation is organized

AKS Engine has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things.

[Tutorials][] take you by the hand through a series of steps on a given subject. Start here if you’re new to AKS Engine.

[Topic guides][] discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

[How-to guides][] are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how the `aks-engine` tool works.

[Community guides][] teach you about the AKS Engine community. It incudes information on the project's Code of Conduct, the planning process for the AKS Engine project itself, its release cycle, and how you can contribute to the project.

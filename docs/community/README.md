AKS Engine is a community effort. As it keeps growing, we always need more people to help others. As soon as you learn AKS Engine, you can contribute in many ways:

- Join the [#aks-engine-users][] and/or [#aks-engine-dev][] public Slack channels on <https://kubernetes.slack.com> and answer questions. By explaining AKS Engine to other users, you’re going to learn a lot about the tool yourself.
- Blog about AKS Engine. We syndicate all the AKS Engine blogs we know about on the [topics page](../topics/README.md); if you’d like to see your blog on that page, you are more than welcome to add it there.
- Contribute to other projects that use AKS Engine, write documentation, or release your own code as an open-source extension. The ecosystem of extensions is a community effort; help us build it!

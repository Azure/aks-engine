## Introduction

Starting from [release](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/releases/) v0.36.2, AKS Engine can be used to provision self-managed Kubernetes clusters on Azure Stack. It is now possible to execute AKS Engine's `generate`, `deploy`, `upgrade`, and `scale` commands as if you were targeting Azure's public cloud. You are only required to slightly update your cluster definition to provide some extra information about your Azure Stack instance.

The goal of this guide is to explain how to provision Kubernetes clusters to Azure Stack using AKS Engine and to capture the differences between Azure and Azure Stack. Bear in mind as well that not every AKS Engine feature or configuration option is currently supported on Azure Stack. In most cases, these are not available because dependent Azure components are not part of Azure Stack.

## Service Principals and Identity Providers

Kubernetes uses a `service principal` identity to talk to Azure Stack APIs to dynamically manage resources such as storage or load balancers. Therefore, you will need to create a service principal before you can provision a Kubernetes cluster using AKS Engine.
This [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-create-service-principals) explains how to create and manage service principals on Azure Stack for both Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) identity providers. This other [guide](../../docs/topics/service-principals.md) is a good resource to understand the permissions that the service principal requires to deploy under your subscription.

## CLI flags

To indicate to AKS Engine that your target platform is Azure Stack, all commands require CLI flag `azure-env` to be set to `"AzureStackCloud"`.

If your Azure Stack instance uses ADFS to authenticate identities, then flag `identity-system` is also required.

``` bash
aks-engine deploy \
    --location local \
    --api-model ./kubernetes.json \
    --resource-group aks-engine-rg \
    --output-directory aks-engine \
    --client-id $SPN_CLIENT_ID \
    --client-secret $SPN_CLIENT_SECRET \
    --subscription-id $TENANT_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
    --azure-env AzureStackCloud
```

## Cluster Definition (aka API Model)

This section details how to tailor your cluster definitions in order to make them compatible with Azure Stack. You can start off from this [template](../../examples/azure-stack/kubernetes-azurestack-azure-ad.json) if your identity provider is AAD or from this other [template](../../examples/azure-stack/kubernetes-azurestack-adfs.json) if you are using ADFS instead.

Unless otherwise specified down below, standard [cluster definition](../../docs/topics/clusterdefinitions.md) properties should also work with Azure Stack. Please create an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/issues/new) if you find that we missed a property that should be called out.

### location

## Azure Stack Instances Registered with Azure's China cloud

If your Azure Stack instance is located in China, then the `dependenciesLocation` property of your cluster definition should be set to `"china"`. This switch ensures that the provisioning process fetches software dependencies from reachable hosts within China's mainland.

## Disconnected Azure Stack Instances

By default, the AKS Engine provisioning process relies on an internet connection to download the software dependencies required to create or upgrade a cluster (Kubernetes images, etcd binaries, network plugins and so on).

If your Azure Stack instance is air-gapped or if network connectivity in your geographical location is not reliable, then the default approach will not work, take a long time or timeout due to transient networking issues.

With these challenges in mind, you can choose to set the `distro` property of your cluster definition to `"aks"`. This change will instruct AKS Engine to deploy VM nodes using a base OS image call `AKS Base Image`. This custom image already contains the required software dependencies in its file system. Hence, internet connectivity wonâ€™t be required during the provisioning process.

The `AKS Base Image` gallery item has to be available in your Azure Stack's Marketplace before it could be used by AKS Engine. Follow this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item) for a general explanation about how to download gallery items from Azure.

Each AKS Engine release is validated and tied to a specific version of the AKS Base Image. Therefore, you need to take note of the base image version required by the AKS Engine release that you plan to use, and then download exactly that base image version. New builds of the `AKS Base Image` are frequently released to ensure that your disconnected cluster can be upgraded to the latest supported version of each component.

## Unsupported Addons

AKS Engine includes a number of optional [addons](../topics/clusterdefinitions.md#addons) that can be deployed as part of the cluster provisioning process.

The list below includes the addons currently unsupported on Azure Stack:

* AAD Pod Identity
* ACI Connector
* Blobfuse Flex Volume
* Cluster Autoscaler
* Container Monitoring
* KeyVault Flex Volume
* NVIDIA Device Plugin
* Rescheduler
* SMB Flex Volume

## Known Issues and Limitations

This section lists all known issues you may find when you use the public preview version.

### Agent Nodes Internet Connectivity

Your agent nodes may lose internet connectivity after all Kubernetes services of type `LoadBalancer` are deleted. You are not expected to experience this problem if no services of type `LoadBalancer` are ever created.

To work around this issue, do not delete `LoadBalancer` services as part of your release pipeline or always keep a dummy service.

### Limited Number of Frontend Public IPs

The `Basic` load balancer SKU available on Azure Stack limits the number of frontend IPs to 5. That implies that each cluster's agents pool is limited to 5 public IPs.

If you need to expose more than 5 services, then the recommendation is to route traffic to those services using an Ingress controller.

### Network Policies

To enforce network policies, you are required to manually deploy the [Canal](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.7/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/flannel) daemonset.

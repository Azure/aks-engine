# For Kubernetes Developers

If you are working on Kubernetes upstream, you can use AKS Engine to test your build of Kubernetes in the Azure environment.

## In a kubernetes/kubernetes PR

If you open a PR on [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), you could enter the following commands in the comment section to build Kubernetes according to your PR changes, deploy it using AKS Engine, and run various tests:

* `/test pull-kubernetes-e2e-aks-engine-azure`: Run Kubernetes conformance tests
* `/test pull-kubernetes-e2e-azure-disk`: Run e2e tests on in-tree Azure Disk plugin
* `/test pull-kubernetes-e2e-azure-disk-vmss`:  Run e2e tests on in-tree Azure Disk plugin in a VMSS-based cluster

## Building Kubernetes From Source

The following instructions describe in more detail how to create the required Docker image and deploy it using AKS Engine (replace `dockerhubid` and `sometag` with your Docker Hub ID and a unique tag for your build):

> NOTE: This build is extremely memory intensive. If you're using Docker For Mac/For Windows, ensure that your docker daemon has access to atleast 4.5 GB of memory and 2 GB of swap size. For Mac OSX see: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advance. For Windows see: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced

The commands to build and publish custom-built Kubernetes are different depending on which Kubernetes version you have. Regardless, they need to be executed in the Kubernetes project root (typically https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes or a fork).

## Kubernetes 1.16 or earlier

* Build Kubernetes and [hyperkube](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/images/hyperkube#hyperkube):

```bash
make clean
make all
make WHAT=cmd/hyperkube
```

* Run the following commands to push the local hyperkube image to a Docker registry (you would need to have access to this registry):

```bash
export VERSION=<your-custom-version>
export REGISTRY=<your-docker-registry>
export HYPERKUBE_BIN=$(pwd)/_output/bin/hyperkube
make -C cluster/images/hyperkube push
```

For `VERSION` environment variable, we recommend that you provide a value which would help you identify the build of kubernetes. It will be used as a tag for your custom hyperkube image.

> NOTE: It's convenient to put these steps into a script.

### AKS Engine API Model

* Open the AKS Engine API Model (e.g. a file from the examples directory). Set `orchestratorRelease` to 1.16 or lower so various defaults and configuration are properly applied to the ARM template and artifacts. Additionally, add the following to the `kubernetesConfig` section:

```
"orchestratorRelease": "1.16",
"kubernetesConfig": {
    ...
    "customHyperkubeImage": "<your-docker-registry>/hyperkube-amd64:<your-custom-version>",
    ...
}
```

* Run `aks-engine deploy` [as normal](../tutorials/deploy.md).

## Kubernetes 1.17+

Since Kubernetes has removed `make WHAT=cmd/hyperkube` command and AKS Engine has stopped supporting hyperkube for Kubernetes 1.17+, we will have to build individual Kubernetes components and deploy them separately. That includes [kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/), [kube-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/), [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/), [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/), [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/), and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).

* Run the following commands to build Kubernetes and push images of individual components:

```bash
export KUBE_DOCKER_REGISTRY=<your-docker-registry>
export KUBE_DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=<your-custom-tag>
make quick-release
docker push <your-docker-registry>/kube-apiserver-amd64:<your-custom-tag>
docker push <your-docker-registry>/kube-controller-manager-amd64:<your-custom-tag>
docker push <your-docker-registry>/kube-proxy-amd64:<your-custom-tag>
docker push <your-docker-registry>/kube-scheduler-amd64:<your-custom-tag>
```

After that, you will have to upload a tarball (`_output/release-tars/kubernetes-node-linux-amd64.tar.gz`) built from the previous step to online storage such as GitHub or Azure Storage. AKS Engine uses the tarball to extract kubelet and kubectl.

### AKS Engine API Model

* Open the AKS Engine API Model (e.g. a file from the examples directory). Set `orchestratorRelease` to 1.17 or higher so various defaults and configuration are properly applied to the ARM template and artifacts. Additionally, add the following to the `kubernetesConfig` section:

```
"orchestratorRelease": "1.17",
"kubernetesConfig": {
    ...
    "customKubeAPIServerImage": "<your-docker-registry>/kube-apiserver-amd64:<your-custom-tag>",
    "customKubeControllerManagerImage": "<your-docker-registry>/kube-controller-manager-amd64:<your-custom-tag>",
    "customKubeProxyImage": "<your-docker-registry>/kube-proxy-amd64:<your-custom-tag>",
    "customKubeSchedulerImage": "<your-docker-registry>/kube-scheduler-amd64:<your-custom-tag>",
    "customKubeBinaryURL": "<URL to uploaded kubernetes-node-linux-amd64.tar.gz>",
    ...
}
```

## Private Registry

If the container registry is private, for example Azure Container Registry, then provide the name of the private Azure registry along with the custom hyperkube image like this:

```
"kubernetesConfig": {
    ...
    "privateAzureRegistryServer": "<your-private-registry>",
    ...
}
```

> NOTE: Make sure the service principal provided to run `aks-engine deploy` has access to pull images from this private registry. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#use-an-existing-service-principal
